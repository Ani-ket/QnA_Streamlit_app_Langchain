This LangChain-based Q&A Streamlit app allows users to interact with custom content, such as PDF documents, using language models and AI systems. It enables various tasks like summarizing documents, extracting highlights, detecting specific mentions, and analyzing writing tone. The app requires an OpenAI API key for accessing language models.

Users can upload a PDF document and ask questions related to its content using a text input field. The app provides examples of queries users can try. After submitting a query, the app processes the request, extracts text from the PDF, and analyzes it using LangChain functionalities.

The app supports different exercises like trying out different language models or working with various file formats like txt, md, csv, and HTML using different document loaders. However, it mentions known limitations, such as being optimized for shorter documents and potential issues with large documents or databases.

The project is attributed to Aniket Dutta and offers a simplified yet functional implementation of a QA system leveraging LangChain capabilities.
