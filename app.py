Interacting with custom content is one of the most popular and powerful usage of LLMs and AI systems,
thanks to the vast amount of application opportunities.

Imagine having a virtual assistant capable of instantly summarizing documents for you, going over long
email threads and only extracting the most relevant and useful information, monitoring your team
communication and early detecting any problem out there. Or maybe you wanna go over a contract
and check for hiccups or contradictions? These and many more things are possible using LangChain,
and this is what we built in this tutorial.

This is a simplified imlementation of a proper QA system. It works well with short documents,
email threads, blog posts, contracts, but it will fail if you provide big documents like books
and big databases. For simplicity, the PDF is loaded as vector using an in-memory storage
(DocArrayInMemorySearch). But remember,sizing an application for his purpose is also an 
important skill, to avoid over-complicating system and wasting processing and financial 
resources.
